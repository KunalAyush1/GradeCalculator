1. Separation of concerns 
 - in prototype logic notebook logic and input are mixed so we cant test functions indeopendently
 - we cant reuse the logic for streamlit UI which we have to!!
 - bugs become hard to isolate
 Solution is - A function should either compute , collect or display not all three
2. Linear execution 
- Python scripts run top -> bottom
- crash immediately if something is undefined
Solution is - Every name must exit before it is used
3. Input must become data not interaction
Solution is - Input layer returns data - it never processes it
3. Validation of CSV files is necessary
